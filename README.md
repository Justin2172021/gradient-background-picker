# gradient-background-picker
This is a simple app that allows you to use two color pickers to blend together a custom background color.  

Features:  
* Two custom color pickers to select real time colors to blend together.  
* A "randomize" button that uses the math methods in JavaScript to output two totally random hex values and runs them through the picker via variables.  
* Real time output of the background gradient so you can visually see your blend and what you will be using if copied.  
* Real time output of the CSS syntax needed to make the current blend work for you in any project.
